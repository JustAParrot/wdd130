    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <!-- Create an additional wireframe for your site. List it here below the Home page wireframe. -->

    <!--212 words-->
    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the home page is to catch the user's attention. This is the one that will have the most 
      images and interactive things. What I want is not only for people to be attracted by the images and how 
      delicious they look, but also how easy is to find what they want. This is the fancy page. The nav
      bar will be at the top left. It will be a hamburger. The options will appear from the left once the click
      is pressed. This is because, as I said before, the content is the one that will have all the possible
      space. Big-sized images will be accompanied by little text boxes explaining what Great Snipe is about.
      Both explanations and reviews will be displayed. Commonly, people have doubts about the quality of the 
      product, authenticity, and price. The Home page has the responsibility of catching the eye's attention
      and providing the common information a user searches for. The button "About us" will be the bigger One
      compared to the others. All the images and text will be aligned like a gallery, showing all types of snacks
      and places around the world. The footer will have the Contact Us function and will be the main source of
      company/web page information.

    <h3>Worldwide Snacks Menu (Ingredients) / Main Topic 2 / Page 2</h3>
    <p>This is THE MAIN SECOND PART of my website. In this page I Want to create a browsing page that allows the
      users to search for the food, drinks, and other bakery-related items they want; all by the country.
      This page will have a couple of small images related to the ones on the Home Page. This will help the users
      recognize the menu more easily. All of the icons, after clicking, will display the options and a type of menu
      that will use the whole page to avoid confusion. I want to make this second page as friendly as possible.
      Every country chosen will have a quick description of the ingredients they usually use to make their food.
      This is a feature small to no food ordering pages have, all because people commonly search for what they already
      know. This information, not only for the country but also for the snacks offered by them, is going
      to give the new snack lovers a little push in the back to search for new and known flavors.
    </p>

    <h4>Order Now (All Items) / Main Topic 3 / Page 3</h3>
    <p>Similar to the second page, The access will be on the home page. The main difference is that this page will
      not have other "sub"options. A list of all the items will be placed to show all the stock for the page. At the
      top of the list, is going to be a search bar to classify and reduce the list. This is something that I have on
      my plans, but not sure if I'm going to be able to complete it. Because this is a web page for a project and not an 
      actual company. I will use a small quantity of items to display. This search bar will help to specify what the
      users want by country, type, and name.
      After the search bar, the item will be displayed in alphabetical order. All of them will contain just a quick 
      overview of what it is, from where, and the price to add to the cart. I am planning to get a better description
      of the product with a button that will open a pop-up window inside or beside the item. This info is also a resume 
      of the one that would be displayed on the second page. This page will be more related to the users who have been 
      here before and the ones who know what they want to buy. This page is meant to be fast, similar to a book index.
      It will have a simple design one image at the top and one at the bottom, but most of the Order Now will be icons 
      and text.
